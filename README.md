<h2>Welcome to my developer portfolio page.</h2>

<p>     I take great proud in my work as a web developer and constantly seek out new technologies to learn about and add to my skillset.</p>
<p>     I have a particular affinity toward creating fun and interactive web pages, building servers, and exploring new, creative ways of using algorithms to optimize my code and add more complex functionality to my projects. I love data visualizations and have several projects in the works that will objects from databases and present the data in fun, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing ways.</p>
<p>     I also plan to study AR/VR development for game development, data interaction and to build a child safety app for parents that utilizes geolocaiton to help track their kid(s) whenever they are out of sight and to minimize the risk of losing track of their child(ren) in public.</p>
<p>Take a look around and let me know if you have any questions. I'm always open to collaborating on a project, picking up a freelance contract job, or discussing new job, business or organiztion opportunities!</p>
